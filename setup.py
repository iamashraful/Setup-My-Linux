This is very begining of the script. I am really bored to setup everything after fresh install.
So, I decided to write this script to setup my several machines. The main job of the script is
following...

1. Install dependencies and peer dependencies from libraries.json file
2. Copy or Move some files if needed
3. Install from source if necessary
